<h1>Cookies Policy</h1>
<p>SimplePDF uses cookies to enhance the user experience and ensure optimal performance of the web application. Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit the site. They help remember your preferences, track usage, and improve functionality.</p>

<p>We use cookies to store theme preferences, such as light or dark mode, track whether users have accepted the cookie banner, and ensure smooth operation of PDF generation tools. Cookies may also be used to gather anonymous statistical data about app usage, allowing us to improve features and interface design.</p>

<p>Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information unless voluntarily provided. Uploaded files and typed content are processed temporarily and are not saved in cookies. These cookies only enhance your experience and do not compromise security or privacy.</p>

<p>By using SimplePDF, you consent to the use of cookies as described in this policy. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but some features may not work correctly without them. This includes saving theme preferences and remembering consent choices.</p>

<p>We may use third-party services to analyze usage patterns or display advertisements. These third-party cookies are subject to their own privacy policies. Users are encouraged to review such policies to understand how their data may be used externally.</p>

<p>Cookies help us detect bugs, monitor performance, and deliver features faster. For example, when generating PDFs or uploading files, cookies ensure that your session remains active and your workflow is uninterrupted. They also assist in maintaining security measures and preventing misuse.</p>

<p>We continuously evaluate the necessity of each cookie used. Only essential cookies are retained permanently; non-essential cookies, such as analytics cookies, are anonymized and do not track personal information. SimplePDF never sells cookie data or uses it for marketing outside the app.</p>

<p>We update this policy periodically to reflect changes in technology or regulations. Users should review the Cookies Policy regularly. If significant changes occur, notifications will be displayed in-app, and users will have the option to re-consent.</p>
